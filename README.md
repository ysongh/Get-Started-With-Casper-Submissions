## Demonstrate key management concepts by modifying the client in the Multi-Sig tutorial to address one of the additional scenarios

### 1) I download the example contract and client for key management

### 2) I compile the smart contract and create the WASM file 

### 3) I compile the smart contract and create the WASM file

### 4) I run the Client Code
